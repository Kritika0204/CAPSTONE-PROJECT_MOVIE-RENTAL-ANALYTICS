# CAPSTONE-PROJECT_MOVIE-RENTAL-ANALYTICS

The primary objective of this project is to conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Sakila DVD Rental Store Database. The goal is to derive valuable insights into the rental store's operations, specifically focusing on customer behavior, film rental patterns, store and inventory management, and sales growth.

This analytical initiative aims to lay the groundwork for developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will equip stakeholders with data-driven decision-making capabilities for managing the rental store business. The ultimate aim is to improve overall business performance by optimizing film inventory, enhancing customer satisfaction, improving staff performance, and streamlining store operations using tools such as MySQL for data management, Power BI for visualization, Excel for analysis, and PowerPoint and Word for reporting and communication.
