# CAPSTONE-PROJECT_MOVIE-RENTAL-ANALYTICS

The primary objective of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Sakila DVD Rental Store Database. The aim is to uncover valuable insights into the rental store's operations, focusing specifically on customer behavior, film rental patterns, store and inventory management, and sales growth.

This analytical effort aims to lay the groundwork for developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will empower stakeholders with data-driven decision-making capabilities for the rental store business. Ultimately, the goal is to improve overall business performance by optimizing film inventory, enhancing customer satisfaction, improving staff performance, and streamlining store operations using tools such as Power BI, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.
